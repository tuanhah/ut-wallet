 * Tasks of picker:
 * - Find withdrawals that can be picked next round (see how records will be chosen in `getNextPickedWithdrawals` method)
 * - Find a hot wallet, which is free (no pending transaction) and sufficient for requesting amount
 * - Create a withdrawal_tx record, which will cover for the withdrawals above:
 *   + For utxo-based currencies, we can process many withdrawals in one tx
 *   + For account-based currencies, we can only process 1 withdrawal in one tx
 * - Update `withdrawal_tx_id` and change `status` to `signing` for all selected withdrawal records
 * - The tx is ready to be signed now
 *
 * Then the transaction should be ready to send to the network
